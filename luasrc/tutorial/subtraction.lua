The subtraction of two integer numbers is very similar to its addition. All you need to do is invert the sign of the second number and sum them, as in `A-B = A + (-B)`, but since -N = NOT(N) + 1, all you need to do is A-B = A + NOT(B) + 1.

This can be done by using the "carry in" of the first `FULL ADDER` in the n-bits adder.
